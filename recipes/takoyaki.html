    <p>Takoyaki is a popular Japanese street food made of a batter filled with diced or minced octopus, tempura scraps, pickled ginger, and green onions. The batter
is cooked in a special molded pan, resulting in round, ball-shaped snacks that are crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. They are typically served with takoyaki sauce, mayonnaise, bonito flakes, and aonori (seaweed flakes).</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups dashi stock</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>1/2 cup diced octopus</li>
        <li>1/4 cup chopped green onions</li>
        <li>1/4 cup tempura scraps</li>
        <li>1/4 cup pickled ginger</li>
        <li>Takoyaki sauce</li>
        <li>Mayonnaise</li>
        <li>Bonito flakes</li>
        <li>Aonori (seaweed flakes)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a bowl, mix the flour, dashi stock, and egg until smooth.</li>
        <li>Heat a takoyaki pan and lightly oil the molds.</li>
        <li>Pour the batter into the molds, filling them about halfway.</li>
        <li>Add diced octopus, green onions, tempura scraps, and pickled ginger to each mold.</li>
        <li>Fill the molds with more batter until they are nearly full.</li>
        <li>Cook for about 3-4 minutes, then use a  skewer to turn the balls over, cooking for another 3-4 minutes until golden brown.</li>
        <li>Remove the takoyaki from the pan and place them on a plate.</li>
        <li>Drizzle with takoyaki sauce and mayonnaise, then sprinkle with bonito flakes and aonori.</li>
        <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>Takoyaki can be customized with various fillings and toppings. Common variations include adding cheese, shrimp, or even different sauces. The key to perfect takoyaki is achieving a crispy exterior while keeping the inside soft and flavorful.</p>
    <h2>Serving Suggestions</h2>
    <p>Takoyaki is often enjoyed as a snack or appetizer. It pairs well with a cold beer or a refreshing green tea. You can also serve it with a side of pickled vegetables or a simple salad to balance the flavors.</p>
